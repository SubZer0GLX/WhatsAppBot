# WhatsAppBot

This was a bot I made in 1 day during the boring covid-19 quarantine as part of a joke in one of my WhatsApp groups. Me and my friends were all complaining about Rafael not having a profile picture, so I made this to remind him to put one every hour, for 8 hours. If he didn't put one something happened :P.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What you'll need to make the app run.

```
[Python](https://www.python.org/) - Programming Language
```

### Installing

First, download [Python](https://www.python.org/) from its official website then install it.(SELECT THE "ADD TO PATH" BOX AT THE START OF INSTALATION)

After Python's instalation, you'll have access to the "pip" command on cmd and with it, install selenium

```
pip install -U selenium
```

Now, extract the files from this project in a folder of your preference and open cmd in this folder by typing cmd in the folder location box and pressing ENTER.

Now just run the bot.py file.

```
python bot.py
```

## The Bot

The bot I built basically mimics a real person, by opening the WhatsAppWeb in the chrome browser, clicking HTML elements and typing things, not big deal, just using the inspector tab in chrome you can know the name of everything you want to click.
